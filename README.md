# NBA MVP Prediction: A Data-Driven Approach to Identify Elite Talent

## Overview

In the dynamic world of professional basketball, identifying and acquiring Most Valuable Player (MVP) caliber talent is a pivotal factor in building championship-winning teams. This project presents a cutting-edge data-driven approach to predict whether an NBA player is likely to become an MVP based on their statistical performance. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and harnessing the power of data, this solution revolutionizes the scouting process, providing teams with a competitive edge in talent acquisition.

## Key Features

- **Accurate Prediction**: Employs a robust Random Forest classifier to predict MVP candidates with exceptional accuracy of 99.64%, precision of 99.29%, and F1 score of 99.65%.
- **Minimized False Negatives**: Boasts a remarkable 100% recall rate, ensuring no potential MVP talent is overlooked.
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Utilizes a multitude of player statistics, including points scored, rebounds, assists, and various efficiency metrics, to capture the holistic essence of elite performance.
- **Feature Engineering**: Incorporates engineered interaction terms to capture synergistic relationships between variables, enhancing the model's predictive capabilities.
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Implements oversampling techniques (SMOTEENN and SMOTE) to address class imbalance, ensuring reliable predictions for both MVP and non-MVP players.
- **Interpretable Results**: Provides insights into the most influential features contributing to MVP performance, enabling data-driven decision-making.

## Skills and Technologies

- **Machine Learning**: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes
- **Data Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, handling missing values, outlier detection
- **Feature Selection**: KBest, LASSO, Decision Trees
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Specificity, ROC Curve, AUC
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Data Manipulation**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Programming**: Python
